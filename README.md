I'm a sophomore pursuing Bachelors in Technology with a specialisation in CS trying to explore all aspects of the platform whith a little bit of inclination towards AI, blockchain and Web3. There is a long road ahead and I will explore all the routes as long as I can. All projects are built from ground up, from idation to planning to implementation. As they say, originality is the key and I'm known to bring visualisable ideas to reality.
